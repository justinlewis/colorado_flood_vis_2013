<h3>A Simple Visualization of selected stream measurements during the 2013 Colorado flood created with D3.js and Leaflet.js to show the dramatic increase in river levels.</h3>


<b>The Charts:</b></br>
Charts illustrate stream discharge over time (Sep 9 - 15). Hover over the chart to get more discharge rates, water levels (ft), percent discharge above average, and the exact date/time.
</br></br>

<b>The Map:</b></br>
The map shows stream gauge locations with symbols sized relative to their peak discharge levels. Click on a station symbol to see the max discharge for that site. Some gauge locations where included (symbolized in black) that have incomplete data and so where excluded from the charts (more details below).
</br></br>

<b>The Data:</b></br>
Data was collected with USGS stream gauges and downloaded from the USGS website. The effort focused on visualizing stream data for rivers that showed the highest increase in discharge. Many stream gauges where destroyed in the flood on rivers with the highest discharge. Because of this the data was incomplete and so we chose not to display those charts. However, we included some of the destroyed gauge locations on the map (symbolized in black) with peak discharge values recorded before the gauge was destroyed.  </br>
